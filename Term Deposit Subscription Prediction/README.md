# Classification-Models


## Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

+ Dataset name - bank_ds.csv is the raw data and bank_ds_cleaned.csv is the processed data for model. Both the dataset are in the data.zip file.

+ Objective - Whether the client has subscribed a term deposit or not.

+ Tools - Python code in Jupyter notebook, Powerpoint, Excel.

+ Algorithm Used - Logistic Regression

  + Logistic Regression - Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, which means predicting the probability of an observation belonging to one of two classes. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It is widely used in machine learning and statistics for tasks such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, and credit scoring.
 
+ Methodology:
  
  •	Data Collection - The data used to build the model was provided in the csv format. It has gender, age, salary and whether the said person purchased the phone or not in 1 and 0 
    format, where 1 stands for yes and 0 for no.

  •	Data Pre-processing - Data pre-processing is a crucial step to ensure the quality and suitability of the dataset for training machine learning models.

  •	Feature Selection - Feature selection is a critical step to identify the most relevant variables that contribute to the predictive power of the model.

  •	Model Selection - In the model selection section, provide a detailed overview of the machine learning algorithms chosen for the predictive analysis. Explain the rationale behind the 
    selection of each algorithm and discuss how they align with the project objectives.
  
  •	Model Training - In the model training section, the processed data is fit to train the selected model so that it is able to predict the future entered data.

  •	Model Evaluation - In the model evaluation section, the performance of the trained machine learning models is assessed to select the best suited model for deployment.
