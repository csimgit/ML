\# Operational Risk Forecasting



\## Objective

Forecast potential operational losses in a company to help risk managers anticipate high-risk periods.



\## Dataset

\- Synthetic dataset with 100+ rows

\- Columns: Date, Operational\_Losses, Department, Event\_Type, External\_Factor



\## Steps

1\. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, one-hot encoding, lag features)

2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (plots, correlations, seasonality)

3\. Model Building

&nbsp;  - Random Forest Regression

&nbsp;  - ARIMA for time series forecasting

4\. Evaluation (MAE, plots of actual vs predicted)

5\. Streamlit dashboard to visualize actual losses and risk alerts
