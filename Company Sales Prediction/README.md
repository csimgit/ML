# Classification-Models

## Campany Sales Prediction

+ Dataset name - company_data.csv is the raw data and company_data_cleaned.csv is the processed data for model. Both the dataset are in the data.zip file.

+ Objective - A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes causes high sale. 

+ Tools - Python code in Jupyter notebook, Powerpoint, Excel.

+ Algorithm Used - Random Forest

  +Random Forest - A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm known for its high accuracy and robustness.

  + Methodology:
  
  •	Data Collection - The data used to build the model was provided in the csv format. It has gender, age, salary and whether the said person purchased the phone or not in 1 and 0 
    format, where 1 stands for yes and 0 for no.

  •	Data Pre-processing - Data pre-processing is a crucial step to ensure the quality and suitability of the dataset for training machine learning models.

  •	Feature Selection - Feature selection is a critical step to identify the most relevant variables that contribute to the predictive power of the model.

  •	Model Selection - In the model selection section, provide a detailed overview of the machine learning algorithms chosen for the predictive analysis. Explain the rationale behind the 
    selection of each algorithm and discuss how they align with the project objectives.
  
  •	Model Training - In the model training section, the processed data is fit to train the selected model so that it is able to predict the future entered data.

  •	Model Evaluation - In the model evaluation section, the performance of the trained machine learning models is assessed to select the best suited model for deployment.
